        <h2 class="heading-sml">What went well?</h2>
            <p>The group was able to delegate tasks quickly and efficiently. No one had any problems with the tasks they were given and completed them in a timely manner. </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">What could be improved? </h2>
            <p>Using the chat in Teams efficiently. Quite a few times we went off topic. Next time we should perhaps create two separate chats, one for on topic discussions and another for general talk. </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">At least one thing that was surprising? </h2>
            <p>The most surprising thing would have to be how well we got along. We have a quite diverse group with people from multiple backgrounds, yet everyone was able to work as a team despite the age differences and cultural differences. </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">At least one thing that you have learned about groups? </h2>
            <p>I’ve learnt how we as a group can utilize all our different skills and combine our efforts to produce a great result. </p>
    
        <h2 class="heading-sml">Github Activity? </h2>
            <p>Our Github log of activity was a great effort for a first try. Personally, my activity looked like it is a bit all over the place since I was still getting used to using Github and forking/merging. However as a team I believe we did quite well in keeping track all of the changes committed and recording them effectively. </p>

        <h2 class="heading-sml">What went well?</h2>
            <p>
                I believe the group was able to efficiently work together to assign roles to the individual members and also everyone was happy to help out whenever any issues arised.
            </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">What could be improved? </h2>
            <p>
                I believe communication during the live meetings often got sidetracked, resulting in unnecessarily long meetings. I think for the next assessment the group needs to try and stay on track and to the point, leaving any unnecessary questions til the end.
            </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">At least one thing that was surprising? </h2>
            <p>
                I was surprised by the positive attitude everyone had towards giving each other a helping hand and how everyone was willing to contribute as much as they could to the assessment. I was also happy to find how well we all got along and that there were no arguments or disagreements between group members. 
            </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">At least one thing that you have learned about groups? </h2>
            <p>
                I have learned that working as a group has many benefits as everyone has their own unique outlook on how to complete tasks, This works well as everyone can use their collective knowledge to improve upon each other's assigned task.
            </p>
    
        <h2 class="heading-sml">Github Activity? </h2>
            <p>
                I believe the gitHub Activity at the beginning was quite messy. but, I believe as the group gained more experience making commits to the repo, their comments and commits where much cleaner and easy for anyone to understand that change involved.

        <h2 class="heading-sml">What went well?</h2>
            <p>
                What went well was how quickly our group formed and built rapport. We had some hurdles finding team members and starting our project, but everything happened so quickly and efficiently. Everyone figured out MS Teams and I personally found it very helpful. Scheduling meetings, taking notes and setting agendas was super helpful.  
            </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">What could be improved? </h2>
            <p>
                In hindsight we all could have been more proactive in seeking team members, initiating participation and starting individual sections of the assignment while waiting for members to become active. I’m sure we will all keep this in mind for future assignments.

            <p>
                I have learnt how effective group help software is, I.e. MS Teams. A platform like this is essential for the collaboration of a new team. I also learnt how handy collaborative file sharing is and that you can have multiple members editing the same file at the same time.  
            </p>
    
        <h2 class="heading-sml">Github Activity? </h2>
            <p>
                Our group had varied GitHub activity but personally my activity started off as minimal changes as I learnt the website styling, CSS, and HTM layout then progressed to more frequent and larger commits.  
            </p>

        <h1 class="heading-lg">Dev's</h1>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">What went well?</h2>
            <p>
                I believe the communication in within the group was very solid, everyone knew their tasks and responsibilities. Also, there were people in the team who were willing to assist other group member with their tasks even if it meant adding extra work on themselves. 
            </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">What could be improved? </h2>
            <p>
                I can only see one improvement needed and that would be to stay on topic more and not get involved into personal matters, but apart from that I think the group was very efficient with the work.  
            </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">At least one thing that was surprising? </h2>
            <p>
                One surprising thing that I noticed was how everyone was willing to help out other team members, it made me feel that I could ask for assistance whenever I needed. Also, everyone did their tasks without any hassles.  
            </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">At least one thing that you have learned about groups? </h2>
            <p>
                I learnt that everyone has very unique viewpoints and that everyone in our group has an idea to share, it was very interesting learning from people who have such a wide amount of knowledge and their point of views going about this assessment.
            </p>
    
        <h2 class="heading-sml">Github Activity? </h2>
            <p>
                Personally, I struggled a little with GitHub, however, there were a couple in our group who were comfortable with it and used it very I had to just sort of listen and watch them go about it in the team meetings to understand how it works even more. 
            </p>
    
        <h3 class="heading-lg">Group Reflection</h3>
        <p>Overall, our group has done an incredible job. We believe our groups “open” and friendly nature has been a huge factor for the progress we have made and the positive attitudes that we still hold, even while conducting a several hour-long meeting on the due date of this assignment. </p>
        <p>The team agrees that things were done much better overall compared to the previous assignment, we made better use of free time, and improved upon organizing meeting times and deadlines, our team meeting notes were more concise creating plans for the whole assignment that the group members can relate back to.  The group did not quarreled over any edits or opinions of layout or design.  </p>
        <p>We made very early use of the collaborative file functions of MS Teams and found the entire Teams service beneficial to our groups progress.</p>
