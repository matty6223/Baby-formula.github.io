            <p>The group was able to delegate tasks quickly and efficiently. No one had any problems with the tasks they were given and completed them in a timely manner. The group helped each other out numerous times and worked effectively. </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">What could be improved? </h2>
            <p>Initial delegating of tasks could have been a bit more detailed as we missed a couple at the start. We did eventually delegate all tasks and finished them all. </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">At least one thing that was surprising? </h2>
            <p>The most surprising thing about working together was how well we managed to communicate throughout the weeks. Efficient communication made it very easy for everyone to keep on top of tasks and provide assistance where needed. </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">At least one thing that you have learned about groups? </h2>
            <p>I have learnt that group composition is very important. If each member does their tasks efficiently and communicates effectively then it makes these projects feel like a breeze. </p>
    
        <h2 class="heading-sml">Github Activity? </h2>
            <p>GitHub Activity was spread out. Not all members worked on GitHub majority of the time, as Matthew took the reins since he was the best among us at HTML and CSS. That being said, we still had efficient and effective commits that detailed exactly what we did. </p>

            <p>
                I believe the group from the first week were able to split up and assign individual tasks to streamline our process. 
            </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">What could be improved? </h2>
            <p>
                I believe very little could be improved upon, the biggest improvement could be finalizing everything before the submission date, although I was happy with how it all turned out. 
            </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">At least one thing that was surprising? </h2>
            <p>
                I was surprised by the positive attitude everyone had towards giving each other a helping hand and how everyone was willing to contribute as much as they could to the assessment. I was also happy to find how well we all got along and that there were no arguments or disagreements between group members.   
            </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">At least one thing that you have learned about groups? </h2>
            <p>
                I have learned that working as a group has many benefits as everyone has their own strengths, this works well as everyone can use their collective knowledge to improve upon each other's assigned task and help each other out when needed. 
            </p>
    
        <h2 class="heading-sml">Github Activity? </h2>
            <p>
                I believe the GitHub Activity a lot more concise with edits this time as the group had gained more experience making commits to the repo, their comments and commits where much cleaner and easy for anyone to understand what change had been made.

            <p>
                This assignment felt like a breeze with the group we have now. Our meetings were not regular but they were long which was excellent for getting some of the work completed collaboratively (live) where shorter meetings would not allow anything other than admin, and short discussions.   
            </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">What could be improved? </h2>
            <p>
                Meeting frequency would have helped if there was enough time in our schedule but the group chose one a week to suit our rather complex timeframe constraints as there are shift workers and emergency services workers in our group.  
            </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">At least one thing that was surprising? </h2>
            <p>
                I was surprised personally at how well the group meshed. We “got along” during assignment 2 but really came together for this one and there were absolutely zero dramas when allocating tasks as we all knew each others strengths and weaknesses.  
            </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">At least one thing that you have learned about groups? </h2>
            <p>
                Groups can be an emotional rollercoaster at times and sometimes this is out of your control. We had some turmoil with a team member that was unprovoked and confusing which created some angst and frustration while trying to move forward with the project.  
            </p>
    
        <h2 class="heading-sml">Github Activity? </h2>
            <p>
                My GitHub contributions where minimal for this assignment as I spent many hours editing videos for the drafty storyboard and final video presentation submissions. Although I did spend some time and many Git commits very early on when creating the “Find A Teacher” landing page which is one of tangible artifacts of our submission.

            <p>
                I think the team was an efficient with this assignment as the tasks were delegated at the beginning and everyone got down to work. Once again, the team was very at fixing up last minute things and were always willing to help others who has un-finished or un-assigned tasks. 
            </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">What could be improved? </h2>
            <p>
                Not much needed to be improved for this time around, maybe a bit clearer understanding of everyone's tasks and making sure all tasks are assigned for someone to complete so that we don’t have to try completing it later during the assignment.  
            </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">At least one thing that was surprising? </h2>
            <p>
                A surprising thing I found was that everyone was able to give constructive feedback on everyone’s tasks which improved work quality. Another surprising thing that I noticed was how everyone was willing to help other team members, it made me feel that I could ask for assistance whenever I needed.  
            </p>
        <h2 class="heading-sml">At least one thing that you have learned about groups? </h2>
            <p>
                I learnt than even though the other members of the group are immensely busy with their day to day lives, they still put in a lot of effort into the assignment and even to help others like me who needed a little extra assistance. 
            </p>
    
        <h2 class="heading-sml">Github Activity? </h2>
            <p>
                GitHub activity this time around was a lot smoother and easier for members to edit and push all their work onto the website while also having a very nicely presented website in the end. Having said that, Matthew and Paul took care of most of the websites presentation and navigation as they are more skilled with HTML and CSS.  
            </p>
    
        <h3 class="heading-lg">Group Reflection</h3>
        <p>Overall, our group has done an incredible job. We believe our groups “open” and friendly nature has been a huge factor for the progress we have made and the positive attitudes that we still hold, even while conducting a several hour-long meeting on the due date of this assignment. </p>
        <p>The team agrees that things were done much better overall compared to the previous assignment, we made better use of free time, and improved upon organizing meeting times and deadlines, our team meeting notes were more concise creating plans for the whole assignment that the group members can relate back to.  The group did not quarreled over any edits or opinions of layout or design.  </p>
        <p>We made very early use of the collaborative file functions of MS Teams and found the entire Teams service beneficial to our groups progress.</p>
