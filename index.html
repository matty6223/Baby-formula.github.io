I have little to no experience in the IT industry; the only thing I can do is build a computer and trouble shoot issues.</p>

            <p>Basic Background: My name is Andrew Dauven from Gen Z and I am a Queenslander,
               so I am from the Sunshine state essentially. I am studying online with RMIT University.
               I have prior experience in software development and have been used to languages like
              C#, Java, Javascript, C++, Python. In the student project we did a mock-up
              interview with the client to get the requirements and analysis for the design of
              the product. From there we worked as a team using the appropriate software development
              methodology, while utilising a workflow board tool like Trello. At home I like to draw,
              design, write poems etc as my hobby.</p>
