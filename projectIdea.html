            <h2 class="heading-md">Overview</h2>
                <p>Find A Teacher is an application for freelance teachers and students. It will be an app that is designed to help people find someone willing to teach a subject that they are passionate about (e.g., learning piano). The App offers the users two different ways to learn; the first option would be meeting with the chosen teacher in real life and the second option would be using the app to perform a video call session. Making use of location services, the app would help students find teachers within their area of choice or within a suitable time zone for video sessions to be conducted. The students will be able to organize times that suit them best for a lesson, and chat with their teachers via the app if they have any questions or concerns between lessons. Payments for lessons will all be handled securely within the app.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-md">Motivation</h2>
                <h3 class="heading-sml">Why is this project important/interesting? </h3>
                    <p>I believe this project is important/interesting because it explores a new way for teachers and students to learn. I believe it’s important because it would make it easier for the students to find a teacher, they enjoy learning from and help them chat with other students too.  </p>
                <h3 class="heading-sml">How does it fit in with current IT trends? </h3>
                    <p>I believe this website fits in with current IT trends by utilizing the cloud to store all required data needed for the functionality of the app. </p>
                <h3 class="heading-sml">What would it show to a future employer? </h3>
                    <p>Upon successful completion of this app, it would show future employers that we can use/learn a wide array of technologies. These include things such as, cloud services, mobile app development, web development and use of google maps API. </p>
            <h2 class="heading-md">Similar apps</h2>
            <h3 class="heading-sml">Fiverr</h3>
                <p>Fiverr has some similarities to Find A Teacher in the way that people offer lessons through the app, although Fiverr works as more of a freelancer landscape and provides a purely online experience. Fiverr works by allowing “sellers” to sell their services for a fee of their choosing and then the “buyers” buy their service for said fee (Fiverr, 2020). After the purchase of the service, it is the seller's responsibility to conduct the video lesson with this student as there is no built-in video chat feature. This works slightly differently to Find A Teacher as Find A Teacher is tailored more towards connecting users with teachers in a setting that allows online sessions through the app but also in-person sessions.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-sml">Udemy</h3>
                <p>Udemy works as a platform for instructors to sell pre-recorded courses, as well as including additional resources and practice activities (Udemy, 2020).
                    Udemy is like Find A Teacher in that it allows freelance teachers to teach subjects they are passionate about. However, Udemy works as a platform for the instructors to sell video recorded course content whereas Find A Teacher is a more personal 1:1 experience, allowing for the benefit of in-person interaction.  </p>

            <h3 class="heading-sml">Aims</h3>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Debitis, tempora.</p>

            <h1 class="heading-lg">Plans and Progress</h3>
            <h2 class="heading-md">How did Find A Teacher start? </h2>
            <p>Find A Teacher started as an idea Matthew Rosin had when having to decide a project idea for assignment 1 in Introduction to Information Technology. He asked, “What app could I benefit from?” and reached the conclusion of an app that could be used to find a piano teacher, but believed the idea was too simple and didn't have enough weight behind it for it to potentially be commercially viable. so, he decided to increase the scope of the project to allow all sorts of different teachers and students to be able to benefit from having a platform which they could easily use to locate private lessons. From assignment 2 the group has been working together to refine the project and bring innovative ideas to the table. </p>
            <h2 class="heading-md">What will the project do? </h2>
            <p>Find A Teacher will deliver a platform for which freelance teachers are offered a platform to advertise and conduct their private lessons, giving them the option to conduct in-person and online lessons. The teachers will be able to teach any subjects they wish, such as math's or cooking. All payment, booking and online sessions will be handled via the app.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-md">What will the project include?</h2>
                <h3 class="heading-sml underline">Both mobile and website versions</h3>
                    <h4 class="heading-smlr">Google maps API</h4>
                        <p>To include the map technology into both the website and app, google maps API would be the best option.</p>
                    <h4 class="heading-smlr">Payment processing</h4>
                        <p>For users to be able to pay for lessons, we believe the best way for the app to handle these is using hosted payment gateways. These payment gateways allow the website to take payment from users without needing much setup and ensuring that their payment information is protected against cyber security threats. </p>
                    <h4 class="heading-smlr">Cybersecurity</h4>
                        <p>To future reduce development time and upkeep, we believe that using a Backend as a service (BaaS) would be ideal. There are several good options, but we believe the best choice is Google’s Firebase. Firebase provides easily scalable backends, analytics, databases and crash reports. </p>
                    <h4 class="heading-smlr">Adobe XD</h4>
                        <p>Adobe XD will be used to create early mockups of the website and mobile versions of the application. An Adobe XD plugin can also be used to translate the design directly into a flutter UI.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-sml underline">Website Version</h3>
                <h4 class="heading-smlr">HTML/CSS/JavaScript </h4>
                    <p>The construction of the website version of the application would require HTML, CSS and JavaScript to be completed. Html is used as the skeleton of the website, adding text, dividing sections of the website and creating multiple pages, CSS would be used to change the presentation of the website by adding styling elements and JavaScript would be used to make the website interactive, adding elements that will engage the users. </p>
                <h4 class="heading-smlr">Web hosting </h4>
                    <p>A reliable web hosting service would be required to reduce the website's downtime and would reduce the cost of the initial start-up. Some of the best options include bluehost, dreamhost and HostGator (Lofgren, L., 2020.).</p>
            <h3 class="heading-sml">Mobile Version</h3>
            <h4 class="heading-smlr">Flutter</h4>
            <p>To create this app easily and smoothly, we believe a cross platform app development tool would be required. There are many options for this such as Xamarin, react native, phone gap and ionic. We believe the best platform would be flutter for several reasons including:</p>
            <ul class="list-container">
                <li>Using flutter reduces time and money spent developing an app by quickly looking native on both android and iOS (flutter,2020).  </li>
                <li>Uses the programming language dart, which is an easy language for developers to learn (flutter,2020).  </li>
                <li>Access to native features such as camera, which is required for phone sessions (flutter,2020).  </li>
                <li>Flutter also has the flutter app builder, which allows you to design the UI of your app for free in a browser (flutter,2020).  </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="heading-smlr">Apple store/google play</h4>
            <p>To deliver the app to all users, it would have to be set up on both the google play store and apple’s app store.</p>

            <h1 class="heading-lg">Progress</h3>
              <p> Our team has decided to make an application and website called “FindATeacher” which helps connect local tutors and teachers to local students who are willing to learn a particular skill or subject. So far, our team has created a mock up of app/website. This includes the Logo, and overall design and color scheme of the application and website. We have also created a few mock up designs of the login screen, search screen and booking status screen just to have an example of how our final app will turn out to be. We have created a landing page for the app advertising what it will be and when it will be released. Flutter is our platform of choice for coding the application itself, we think it would be the best platform due to numerous reasons mentioned in the planning section. As for integrating maps, we have decided to use google maps API, for cybersecurity Google’s firebase will be used and Adobe XD was used to create application UI and as it is directly transferable to Flutter. Also, 3 members of the team have created a short video which clearly identifies the implications of the app and shows as an example of how it will look when it is complete. Apart from that the team is still researching on the works of flutter and will soon begin coding the app and creating the website. </p>

            <!-- Roles -->
        <div class="shrink" id="Roles" style="display: none;">
            <h2 class="heading-md">Roles</h2>
            <p>In a normal project setting, from the creation of the idea the next step would be to incorporate different roles that would take over various parts of the project. In order to fill these roles, there are steps in place such as interviews and applications that assess each potential employee’s capabilities to best suit the role they apply for. The candidates would need experience, knowledge, and overall expertise in their respective fields to be the ideal candidate for the role they have applied for. Once the assessments have finalized, the employer would select the ideal candidate(s) to fill the roles that are required for the project, and the project would be underway.</p>
            <p>As most of the group project revolves around incorporating different ideas, the talk of roles has come up in group discussions. The project focuses on the creation of ‘Find A Teacher’, an app/website designed to match students with ideal tutors. As the weeks have progressed, the group has continued to incorporate new and exciting ideas to evolve the project, such as the app design, the website layout, the name, and the logo. Each member of the group has worked on various parts of the project, providing insight and assistance to each other.</p>
            <p>Firstly, in contrast to a normal project in business, ‘Find A Teacher’ has not been created to generate revenue. Instead it is the concept of a project for class and has been developed to suit certain requirements for an assessment. Due to this, there has been no need to generate roles to take over certain parts of the project.</p>
            <p>Secondly, due to the nature of the group’s formation each member has a shared workload. The group was not formed by means of interviews, assessments, and applications. The group has formed to collaborate on a project for a university task. Due to this, there has not been the standard employment process to fill roles for a project in a business setting; instead a group has formed and chose an idea to pursue, and each member works like a cog-wheel in the sense that everyone helps one another to succeed.</p>
            <p>By the two facts previously mentioned, the group has concluded that there is no need for roles. Each member has different range of tasks delegated to them, from logo creation, to UI design, to planning. The group believes the most effective method of developing this project is to combine the shared knowledge and experience, rather than have members focus on one specific task. By doing this, the group can incorporate different perspectives and opinions quite easily and establish the correct direction the project will head towards.</p>

            <!-- Scope and Limits -->
        <div class="shrink" id="Scope" style="display: none;">
            <h2 class="heading-md">Scope and Limits</h2>
            <p>As with most projects, defining the scope and limitations are based on numerous factors such as timeframe, manpower, workload, goals, and funding to name a few. With the Find a Teacher project, the overall goal is to create an app/website that is able to match teachers to students. Due to time constraints, that goal is out of reach for the time being. The priority for the project is to create the designs for the website and user-interface. As the main functionality of the project will be through the use of the app and/or the website, priorities will revolve around design so that there are sufficient deliverables to present. This will lead the way into designing the functionality of the app and the website, which will enable the group to show proof-of-concept. </p>
            <p>The reasoning behind choosing to revolve priorities around the design is due to the number of limitations that prevents the project from being developed. First limitations is time, as it is for a university project the group does not have a lot of time to invest due to other assignments and modules. Second is manpower, which ties directly into time as if the group had more members to work on the project, tasks could be spread out easier allowing each member to invest more time into their singular task, rather than juggle multiple tasks. Third is goals, as the goal for the assignment is to deliver a proof-of-concept rather than a full functioning app/website, the group is focusing on deliverables rather than the completion of the project. If the group decided that this project will evolve from an assignment into a full-fledged project, these limitations would be overcome primarily by funding. As it stands, the project will remain as a proof-of-concept. </p>

            <h3 class="heading-sml">Testing</h3>
            <p>To test our application and website, we will require a number of volunteers or participants, preferably those who are students (anyone who wants to gain knowledge or learn/practice a skill), and teachers (anyone who are able to and have a licence to teach a particular subject or skill). As for the exact number of testers, we are expecting from around 20-30 students and teachers in the local area. We would like to perform 3 stages of testing. The first being early stage, where our goals will be more focused on exploration and discovery of the app and its features. This includes things like navigation of the app, basic mapping of our features and appearance. For our next stage, we would like to test the interaction of our app's hierarchy, structure, and feature set. At this testing stage for our app and website, we would most likely want to test basic functionality, including the communication feature between students and teachers, along with the student/teacher location system within the program. At this stage, the payment transfer methods and will also be tested and perfected along with privacy and security measures. The third and final stage of testing will be on how the app is performing, opportunities for optimization, and whether your user experience appeals to users. This stage can only be test when it is officially launched on Google Play store and Apple App store alongside the website. Throughout this testing it is important that we are not looking for generic feedback, but rather looking to uncover specific problems within our program and work towards refining the user experience. Alternatively, we can also look to test our app with a third-party organisation which specializes in doing so such as the company ‘Usertesting’.

            <!-- Risks -->
        <div class="shrink" id="Risks" style="display: none;">
            <h2 class="heading-md">Risks</h2>
            <p>There are numerous risks involved with starting any project. Due to the nature of the group’s chosen project, most of the risks will revolve around software. When creating an app or website there are numerous tools and technologies that are used to develop and maintain said app or website. Without delving into the specific software that will be required, the risks involved are still evident. Firstly, the software may not be compatible with our operating system. If there is an app that is great for designing UI but is only available on Macintosh, then the group members who do not have Macs would not be able to use them and therefore would have to seek alternative apps in order to compromise. The software may also not be up to date to address modern-day needs, such as if the design needs to be creative but the software may not provide the necessary tools to accomplish that. Perhaps there may not be enough guides or tutorials on how to use the said software, which would slow progress and hinder the software development a lot. As without proper guidance and direction on how to use new software development can slow to a halt, since it would require new learning to take place before applying it to the software. Lastly, the software may be costly which would mean committing to using the software without prior experience and testing. Purchasing anything before prior use poses risk, especially when it comes to software since it can be very costly and temperamental.</p>
            <p>There are also the risks involved outside of the software development itself. Since this is the group’s first project, it is new territory for each member to learn and experience. Prior knowledge would be very beneficial, and without it would slow progress once again. Another risk that is quite evident is the lack of funding for the project. If there are no potential investors, then the project would be quite costly and difficult to maintain. The group would also run the risk of building this project that the target users may not want. Choosing and identifying target users is crucial in a project like this since the entire idea revolves around numerous users. On the opposite end of the spectrum, another challenge is what would happen if too many users jump on board all at once. The risk involved is the platform not being efficient or powerful enough to be able to support countless users.</p>
            <p>Security is a big issue when it comes to projects, as the information created as development progresses is crucial to the project. Security breaches are certainly nothing new, though the danger here lies in underestimating the need for proper security precautions within the app and website. If the project solely relies on the security of the mobile devices for example, it could result in data compromises or even infrastructural breaches. The project will be handling sensitive user information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and banking details. Security will pose a big risk if underestimated.</p>
