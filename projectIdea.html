            <h2 class="heading-md">Overview</h2>
                <p>Find A Teacher is an application for freelance teachers and students. It will be an app that is designed to help people find someone willing to teach a subject that they are passionate about (e.g., learning piano). The App offers the users two different ways to learn; the first option would be meeting with the chosen teacher in real life and the second option would be using the app to perform a video call session. Making use of location services, the app would help students find teachers within their area of choice or within a suitable time zone for video sessions to be conducted. The students will be able to organize times that suit them best for a lesson, and chat with their teachers via the app if they have any questions or concerns between lessons. Payments for lessons will all be handled securely within the app.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-md">Motivation</h2>
                <h3 class="heading-sml">Why is this project important/interesting? </h3>
                    <p>I believe this project is important/interesting because it explores a new way for teachers and students to learn. I believe it’s important because it would make it easier for the students to find a teacher, they enjoy learning from and help them chat with other students too.  </p>
                <h3 class="heading-sml">How does it fit in with current IT trends? </h3>
                    <p>I believe this website fits in with current IT trends by utilizing the cloud to store all required data needed for the functionality of the app. </p>
                <h3 class="heading-sml">What would it show to a future employer? </h3>
                    <p>Upon successful completion of this app, it would show future employers that we can use/learn a wide array of technologies. These include things such as, cloud services, mobile app development, web development and use of google maps API. </p>
            <h2 class="heading-md">Similar apps</h2>
            <h3 class="heading-sml">Fiverr</h3>
                <p>Fiverr has some similarities to Find A Teacher in the way that people offer lessons through the app, although Fiverr works as more of a freelancer landscape and provides a purely online experience. Fiverr works by allowing “sellers” to sell their services for a fee of their choosing and then the “buyers” buy their service for said fee (Fiverr, 2020). After the purchase of the service, it is the seller's responsibility to conduct the video lesson with this student as there is no built-in video chat feature. This works slightly differently to Find A Teacher as Find A Teacher is tailored more towards connecting users with teachers in a setting that allows online sessions through the app but also in-person sessions.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-sml">Udemy</h3>
                <p>Udemy works as a platform for instructors to sell pre-recorded courses, as well as including additional resources and practice activities (Udemy, 2020).
                    Udemy is like Find A Teacher in that it allows freelance teachers to teach subjects they are passionate about. However, Udemy works as a platform for the instructors to sell video recorded course content whereas Find A Teacher is a more personal 1:1 experience, allowing for the benefit of in-person interaction.  </p>
