            <h2 class="heading-md">Overview</h2>
                <p>Find A Teacher is an application for freelance teachers and students. It will be an app that is designed to help people find someone willing to teach a subject that they are passionate about (e.g., learning piano). The App offers the users two different ways to learn; the first option would be meeting with the chosen teacher in real life and the second option would be using the app to perform a video call session. Making use of location services, the app would help students find teachers within their area of choice or within a suitable time zone for video sessions to be conducted. The students will be able to organize times that suit them best for a lesson, and chat with their teachers via the app if they have any questions or concerns between lessons. Payments for lessons will all be handled securely within the app.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-md">Motivation</h2>
                <h3 class="heading-sml">Why is this project important/interesting? </h3>
                    <p>I believe this project is important/interesting because it explores a new way for teachers and students to learn. I believe it’s important because it would make it easier for the students to find a teacher, they enjoy learning from and help them chat with other students too.  </p>
                <h3 class="heading-sml">How does it fit in with current IT trends? </h3>
                    <p>I believe this website fits in with current IT trends by utilizing the cloud to store all required data needed for the functionality of the app. </p>
                <h3 class="heading-sml">What would it show to a future employer? </h3>
                    <p>Upon successful completion of this app, it would show future employers that we can use/learn a wide array of technologies. These include things such as, cloud services, mobile app development, web development and use of google maps API. </p>
            <h2 class="heading-md">Similar apps</h2>
            <h3 class="heading-sml">Fiverr</h3>
                <p>Fiverr has some similarities to Find A Teacher in the way that people offer lessons through the app, although Fiverr works as more of a freelancer landscape and provides a purely online experience. Fiverr works by allowing “sellers” to sell their services for a fee of their choosing and then the “buyers” buy their service for said fee (Fiverr, 2020). After the purchase of the service, it is the seller's responsibility to conduct the video lesson with this student as there is no built-in video chat feature. This works slightly differently to Find A Teacher as Find A Teacher is tailored more towards connecting users with teachers in a setting that allows online sessions through the app but also in-person sessions.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-sml">Udemy</h3>
                <p>Udemy works as a platform for instructors to sell pre-recorded courses, as well as including additional resources and practice activities (Udemy, 2020).
                    Udemy is like Find A Teacher in that it allows freelance teachers to teach subjects they are passionate about. However, Udemy works as a platform for the instructors to sell video recorded course content whereas Find A Teacher is a more personal 1:1 experience, allowing for the benefit of in-person interaction.  </p>

            <h3 class="heading-sml">Aims</h3>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Debitis, tempora.</p>

            <h1 class="heading-lg">Plans and Progress</h3>
            <h2 class="heading-md">How did Find A Teacher start? </h2>
            <p>Find A Teacher started as an idea Matthew Rosin had when having to decide a project idea for assignment 1 in Introduction to Information Technology. He asked, “What app could I benefit from?” and reached the conclusion of an app that could be used to find a piano teacher, but believed the idea was too simple and didn't have enough weight behind it for it to potentially be commercially viable. so, he decided to increase the scope of the project to allow all sorts of different teachers and students to be able to benefit from having a platform which they could easily use to locate private lessons. From assignment 2 the group has been working together to refine the project and bring innovative ideas to the table. </p>
            <h2 class="heading-md">What will the project do? </h2>
            <p>Find A Teacher will deliver a platform for which freelance teachers are offered a platform to advertise and conduct their private lessons, giving them the option to conduct in-person and online lessons. The teachers will be able to teach any subjects they wish, such as math's or cooking. All payment, booking and online sessions will be handled via the app.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-md">What will the project include?</h2>
                <h3 class="heading-sml underline">Both mobile and website versions</h3>
                    <h4 class="heading-smlr">Google maps API</h4>
                        <p>To include the map technology into both the website and app, google maps API would be the best option.</p>
                    <h4 class="heading-smlr">Payment processing</h4>
                        <p>For users to be able to pay for lessons, we believe the best way for the app to handle these is using hosted payment gateways. These payment gateways allow the website to take payment from users without needing much setup and ensuring that their payment information is protected against cyber security threats. </p>
                    <h4 class="heading-smlr">Cybersecurity</h4>
                        <p>To future reduce development time and upkeep, we believe that using a Backend as a service (BaaS) would be ideal. There are several good options, but we believe the best choice is Google’s Firebase. Firebase provides easily scalable backends, analytics, databases and crash reports. </p>
                    <h4 class="heading-smlr">Adobe XD</h4>
                        <p>Adobe XD will be used to create early mockups of the website and mobile versions of the application. An Adobe XD plugin can also be used to translate the design directly into a flutter UI.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-sml underline">Website Version</h3>
                <h4 class="heading-smlr">HTML/CSS/JavaScript </h4>
                    <p>The construction of the website version of the application would require HTML, CSS and JavaScript to be completed. Html is used as the skeleton of the website, adding text, dividing sections of the website and creating multiple pages, CSS would be used to change the presentation of the website by adding styling elements and JavaScript would be used to make the website interactive, adding elements that will engage the users. </p>
                <h4 class="heading-smlr">Web hosting </h4>
                    <p>A reliable web hosting service would be required to reduce the website's downtime and would reduce the cost of the initial start-up. Some of the best options include bluehost, dreamhost and HostGator (Lofgren, L., 2020.).</p>
            <h3 class="heading-sml">Mobile Version</h3>
            <h4 class="heading-smlr">Flutter</h4>
            <p>To create this app easily and smoothly, we believe a cross platform app development tool would be required. There are many options for this such as Xamarin, react native, phone gap and ionic. We believe the best platform would be flutter for several reasons including:</p>
            <ul class="list-container">
                <li>Using flutter reduces time and money spent developing an app by quickly looking native on both android and iOS (flutter,2020).  </li>
                <li>Uses the programming language dart, which is an easy language for developers to learn (flutter,2020).  </li>
                <li>Access to native features such as camera, which is required for phone sessions (flutter,2020).  </li>
                <li>Flutter also has the flutter app builder, which allows you to design the UI of your app for free in a browser (flutter,2020).  </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="heading-smlr">Apple store/google play</h4>
            <p>To deliver the app to all users, it would have to be set up on both the google play store and apple’s app store.</p>
